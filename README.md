# Tech Quiz

Taking a fully functioning Tech Quiz application, I enhanced it by adding Cypress for both compenent and end-to-end tests. 

The app is developed with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js), it enables users to take a quiz of 10 questions and displaying their final scores at the end.
